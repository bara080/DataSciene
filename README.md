# Linear Regression on Iris Dataset

This Python script demonstrates how to perform linear regression on the Iris dataset using the scikit-learn library. The script includes the following steps:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Necessary libraries such as NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn are imported.

2. **Loading the Dataset**: The Iris dataset is loaded using seaborn's `load_dataset` function.

3. **Extracting Features and Target Variable**: Specific columns for petal length and width are extracted as features (X) and the target variable (y), respectively.

4. **Splitting the Data**: The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.

5. **Creating and Fitting the Model**: A Linear Regression model is created and fitted to the training data.

6. **Predicting the Target Variable**: The model is used to predict the target variable for both the training and test data.

7. **Plotting the Results**: Scatter plots are created to visualize the training and test data, along with the regression lines fitted by the model.

To run this script, ensure you have the required libraries installed and execute the code in a Python environment. The Iris dataset will be loaded, and linear regression will be performed to predict the petal width based on the petal length. The resulting plots will display the regression lines for both the training and test data.
